## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### What I learned

This was my first time working with the DOM, and I learned a lot throughout the process. I got hands-on experience handling not only click events, but also screen resize events. I also took the opportunity to reflect on function designâ€”understanding when and why to wrap code in reusable functions to make my script cleaner and more efficient.

To ensure I was following clean code practices, I added prettier and eslint to check basic coding rules that I personally like to follow. These tools helped me make sure that those principles are applied throughout the entire project.

When it comes to styling, I explored how to implement a dark theme using existing CSS classes and specificity, avoiding unnecessary or redundant CSS rules.

One unexpected challenge was dealing with styling issues on mobile browsers, particularly in Chrome. I discovered that Android often applies default styles to elements like scrollbars and sticky hover states, which are very difficult to override with CSS. These limitations forced me to rethink and redesign certain parts of the interface to ensure a better user experience.

The toughest part of the project was managing the interaction between drag-and-drop functionality and vertical scrolling on mobile devices. Scrolling through draggable tasks was frustrating, so I ended up adding space on the right side of the task container to enable smooth scrolling without interfering with drag-and-drop.

I also had my first experience handling form data directly from HTML, which was a great learning opportunity.

ðŸ’¡ CSS tip: Check out how I implemented dark theme styles by reusing existing CSS classes effectively.

```css
.dark-theme .task__dashboard,
.dark-theme .task__summary {
  box-shadow: 0px 35px 50px -15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

Regarding Javascript, this was also my first time trying a js library for helping me building the drag and drop functionality: Sortable js. After doing some internet research, I found out this simple yet effective library that, with few lines of code, allowed me to build an amazing drag and drop effect on tasks.

During the refactoring process, I learned the importance and benefits of modularizing a JavaScript project. I explored how to break down the codebase into logical modules based on the main entities of the app, such as task and theme. For each entity, I separated concerns into dedicated files for local storage management and UI handling. This approach made the code more organized, maintainable, and scalable.

Project's current folder structure:

```
todo-app-main/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icons/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ActionKeys.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IStorage.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ script.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Theme/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ThemeStorageManager.mjs
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ThemeUIManager.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TaskBuilder.mjs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TaskModel.mjs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TaskService.mjs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TaskStorageManager.mjs
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TaskUiManager.mjs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ normalizeData.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ style.css
```

### Continued development

I still need to work on:

- Modularizing the task filtering UI functions (`all`, `active`, `completed`) and Task status updaters in localStorage functions.

### Useful resources

- [Platzi DOM course](https://platzi.com/cursos/document-object-model/) - This helped me for understanding and practicing DOM manipulation.
- [Mouredev Intermediate JS course](https://github.com/mouredev/hello-javascript) - This repository consists of a series of live classes regarding beginner and intermediate javascript concepts for all purposes. It helped me getting the basis of the language and go further with POO and advanced functions.
- [Sortable JS library](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) - The js library that helped me build the drag and drop functionality
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/install) - A js code formatter, ensuring consistent style
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) - An extra code checker to find and fix problems with your JavaScript code, f.e: unused variables.
